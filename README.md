# FreeCellSolver

The following is a FreeCell Solver using ASP, C#, and Unity. The Solver was created for a project requirment during a course in logic programming. The project shows the abilty for Answer Set Programing(ASP) to solve complex problems with relativly few lines of code. The solver uses Microsofts original dealing algoritm created by Jim Horne. The code implementing this algoritm was borrowed from rosettacode.org(see Acknowledgements). This deals 32000 unique deals of which #11982 is unsolvable. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Demo

## Acknowledgments

For the Unity/GUI portion of this project, I used Matt from Megalomobile's tutorial for building a solitare game, altering the game to a freecell solitare version. This is great tutorial and was extremly helpful in the creation of the interface for the solver.
